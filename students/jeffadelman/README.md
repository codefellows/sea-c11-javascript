Jeff Adelman

Hello! I am a new transplant to the Seattle area from Los Angeles. I've worked in the entertainment industry (both in front of and behind the camera) for 15 years. I've always been interested in computers and in 2009 was hired to work at TMZ.com. Working with TMZ got me really interested in the tech side of the entertainment business and I started looking at ways to get more involved. That's how I discovered coding and I love it! I've been teaching myself on CodeAcademy, Treehouse and other sites and am really excited to be starting the Code Fellows Level 2 JavaScript training! Really looking forward to it!!

My immediate goal is to join the JavaScript bootcamp and start working as a developer. My long term goals lie with startups and companies that are combining entertainment and web. Online content and video over web. Think Hulu, Netflix, and any number of startups developing in this area!
